# tic_tac_toe

This project is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players. Players take turns placing their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The winner is the first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). If all the cells are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is declared a draw.

## Explanation:
- Players take turns entering coordinates (row and column) to place their mark on the game board.
- The program checks the validity of the move and updates the game grid.
- After each move, the program checks for a win or a draw.
- The game ends when one player wins or there is a draw.
